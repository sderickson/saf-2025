# Examples

The workflows tool is developed in conjunction with [SAF](https://docs.saf-demo.online/), so there are many examples of workflows there. You can find them in the [SAF docs](https://docs.saf-demo.online/) if you scan the sidebar and click "Workflows" links, they are grouped by SAF package. Those docs link to the original source as well, so that's probably the best way to find the routine workflows.

I don't have as many examples of complex workflows available in open source, but there was one experiment where I created a [secret store](https://github.com/sderickson/saflib/tree/main/notes/2025-09-17-add-secret-store) with them. Any further complex workflows I create for SAF development will be added to that `notes/` directory. And when I create complex workflows for other public projects, I'll list them here.
