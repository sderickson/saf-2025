# Auth Database Library Specification

## Overview

The Auth Database Library project aims to refactor the authentication database implementation from `saf-2025/dbs/auth` into a reusable library package. This refactoring will improve code organization and enable sharing of the authentication database between services.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to use a shared authentication database library so that I can maintain consistent user data across services
- As a service developer, I want to connect to the auth database from multiple services so that I can implement distributed authentication features

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema

The existing schema from `dbs/auth` will be preserved exactly as is:

- Table/Model: Users
  - Fields: [existing fields from current implementation]
  - Relationships: [existing relationships]
- Table/Model: Sessions
  - Fields: [existing fields from current implementation]
  - Relationships: [existing relationships]

### API Interface

The library will maintain the existing API interface

### Frontend SPA

No frontend changes are required for this project.

### Dependencies

- SQLite3
- Drizzle ORM
- TypeScript
- Node.js v18+

## Questions and Clarifications

1. What is the expected maximum number of concurrent connections?
2. Should we implement a connection timeout mechanism?
3. What is the expected data volume and growth rate?
