# Auth Database Library Specification

## Overview

The Auth Database Library project aims to refactor the authentication database implementation from `saf-2025/dbs/auth` into a reusable library package. This refactoring will improve code organization, enable better sharing of the authentication database between services, and provide a more robust foundation for future authentication features.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to use a shared authentication database library so that I can maintain consistent user data across services
- As a system administrator, I want to manage authentication data in a centralized location so that I can maintain better control over user access
- As a service developer, I want to connect to the auth database safely from multiple services so that I can implement distributed authentication features

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Updates

The existing schema from `dbs/auth` will be preserved, but we need to ensure it supports:

- Table/Model: Users
  - Fields: [existing fields from current implementation]
  - Relationships: [existing relationships]
- Table/Model: Sessions
  - Fields: [existing fields from current implementation]
  - Relationships: [existing relationships]
- Table/Model: Permissions (new)
  - Fields: id, user_id, scope, created_at, updated_at
  - Relationships: belongs to Users

### API Endpoints

The library will provide a clean interface for database operations:

1. Connection Management

   - Purpose: Handle database connections and pooling
   - Methods:
     - `createConnection(config: ConnectionConfig): Promise<Connection>`
     - `getConnection(): Connection`
     - `closeConnection(): Promise<void>`

2. User Operations

   - Purpose: Manage user data
   - Methods:
     - `createUser(data: UserData): Promise<User>`
     - `getUser(id: string): Promise<User>`
     - `updateUser(id: string, data: Partial<UserData>): Promise<User>`
     - `deleteUser(id: string): Promise<void>`

3. Session Operations

   - Purpose: Handle user sessions
   - Methods:
     - `createSession(userId: string, data: SessionData): Promise<Session>`
     - `getSession(id: string): Promise<Session>`
     - `deleteSession(id: string): Promise<void>`
     - `cleanupExpiredSessions(): Promise<void>`

4. Permission Operations
   - Purpose: Manage user permissions
   - Methods:
     - `addPermission(userId: string, scope: string): Promise<Permission>`
     - `removePermission(userId: string, scope: string): Promise<void>`
     - `getUserPermissions(userId: string): Promise<Permission[]>`

### Frontend SPA

No frontend changes are required for this project.

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Considerations

- Implement connection pooling to handle multiple service connections efficiently
- Use appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement caching where appropriate for read-heavy operations

### Security Considerations

- Ensure proper file permissions for the database file
- Implement proper connection string handling
- Add input validation for all database operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Compatibility Issues

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing auth service
- Ensure smooth migration path for existing data
- Support both single-service and multi-service deployments

### Dependencies

- SQLite3
- Drizzle ORM
- TypeScript
- Node.js v18+

## Future Enhancements / Out of Scope

- Database migration tools for schema updates
- Additional database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Real-time sync capabilities
- Advanced caching mechanisms
- Backup and restore utilities

## Questions and Clarifications

1. What is the expected maximum number of concurrent connections?
2. Should we implement a connection timeout mechanism?
3. Do we need to support read replicas?
4. What is the expected data volume and growth rate?
5. Should we implement any rate limiting for database operations?
